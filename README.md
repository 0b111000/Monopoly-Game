# Monopoly-Game (Business game)
My first CPP project.
It is user friendly, user interactice monopoly game.
You just need two dice(don't worry if you don' have them. I have taken care of that too) and this application/code to play one of the interesting multiplayer games.
It's a pure terminal application(using CLI). So, don't expect any graphics please. :)
Please let me know if there are any bugs in the application.

To Play this game, change directory to src and run 'make all' in the linux terminal which would generate two executable files: businessgame and dicegenerator and run the businessgame executable using ./businessgame which would start the game and also opens a new terminal where the dice generator is running and generates a random number from 2-12.

(Since it is a CLI only, suggested layout for best vision of terminal in ubuntu is: enter fullscreen mode and zoom out till you get the board perfectly)
