# Monopoly-Game (Business game)
My first CPP project.
It is user friendly, user interactice monopoly game.
You just need two dice(don't worry if you don' have them. I have a code for that too. Just compile it :p) and this application/code to play one of the interesting multiplayer games.
It's a pure terminal application(using CLI). So, don't expect any graphics please. :)
Please let me know if there are any bugs in the application.

(For windows, use 'Monopoly.exe')

(For linux open a terminal and change to the directory where the 'Monopoly_linux_executable' is present and execute it using terminal with command : ./Monoploy_linux_executable after changing the permissions to execute.)


NOTE : If You are working on windows, You may need libstdc++-6.dll and libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll for that application to run. So, I uploaded those files also in the repo.

(Since it is a CLI only, suggested layout for best vision of terminal in ubuntu is: enter fullscreen mode and zoom out once and for windows cmd is keep the font size 12 in properties and enter fullscreen)
