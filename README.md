# Monopoly-Game
My first CPP project.
It is user friendly, user interactice monopoly game.
You just need two dice(don't worry if you don' have them. I have a code for that too :p) and this application/code to play one of the interesting multiplayer games.
It's a pure terminal application(using CLI). So, don't expect any graphics please. :)
Please let me know if there are any bugs in the application.
(For windows, Monopoly.exe; for linux open a terminal and change to the directory where the Monopoly_linux_executable is present and execute it using terminal with command : ./Monoploy_linux_executable )
